## Objective

Reach the other side of the water without being touched by the cockroaches (bugs). When your player reaches the water you advance to the next level where the difficulty increases [bugs move faster]. If your player collides with a bug you regress back to level 1 [where the speed goes to default, a slower speed from any other level].

## How To Move

Use arrow keys to move your player.
